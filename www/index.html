                The computer chooses a word, and you have to guess it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Objective: Guess the secret word.

                Make Your Guess:
                
                Each guess must be a valid word.
                Semantle will tell you how semantically similar your guessed word is to the secret word.
                Understanding Semantic Similarity:
                
                The game uses Word2Vec to calculate the semantic similarity between your guess and the secret word.
                Similarity is based on the meaning and context of words, not their spelling.
                The highest similarity score is 100, meaning the words are identical and you win.
                The lowest possible score is -100, but typically, scores won't be lower than -34.
                Word Types:
                
                Secret words can be any part of speech but will always be single words.
                Avoid focusing only on nouns; consider all types of words.
                Guesses are case-sensitive since the Word2Vec dataset includes some proper nouns. However, all secret words are lower-case. If your guess matches the secret word except for case, you still win.
                Getting Close Indicator:
                
                If your guess is one of the 1,000 closest words to the target word, its rank will be displayed (with 1000 being the target word itself).
                If your guess is not within the closest 1,000 words, you are considered "cold".
                Only "normal" words (non-capitalized, common words) get a ranking. Capitalized, misspelled, or obscure words that might be close will be marked with "????".
                Example:
                
                If the secret word is "happy" and you guess "joyful," you might get a high similarity score.
                If you guess "sad," the similarity score will be much lower.
                Tip: Try words with different meanings and parts of speech to find the secret word faster!
